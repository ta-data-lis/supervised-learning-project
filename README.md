# Supervised Learning Project

## Overview

For my Supervised Machine Learning project I chose a dataset that contains information on 4240 patients and on wether they have developed a heart disease or not. Using this data, I then built a classification algorithm that can be used as a tool by doctors to easier and faster predict - based on the patient's characteristics - whether this patient will develop a heart disease or not. 

Information on the features are included in the Notebook.

The dataset is openly accessible from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/amanajmera1/framingham-heart-study-dataset/kernels).


## Technical Information

1. Python was used as the programming language.
2. Pandas was used for reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe.
3. Scikit-learn was used for training and testing the Machine Learning model.


## Algorithm

I tested 4 Classification Algorithms and chose the K-Nearest Neighbour model since it resulted in the highest accurancy score.
